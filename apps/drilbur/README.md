# WIP Readme

Add a `drilbur` alias to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.

```nano
alias drilbur="bash drilbur.sh"
```

This is not required but a handy alternative to

```bash
# /apps/drilbur
bash drilbur.sh
```

Now in the drilbur folder you can simply run

```bash
# /apps/drilbur
drilbur
```

## Run Project in Dev Mode

#### 1. install dev tools

```bash
drilbur install
```

#### 2. run dev mode

```bash
drilbur dev
```
